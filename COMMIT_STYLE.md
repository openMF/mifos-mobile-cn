# Git Commit Message Style Guide

## Commit Messages

### Message Structure
A commit messages consists of three distinct parts separated by a blank line: the title, an optional body and an optional footer. The layout looks like this:

type: subject

body

footer

***

The title consists of the type of the message and subject.

### The Type
The type is contained within the title and can be one of these types:

* **feat:** a new feature
* **fix:** a bug fix
* **docs:** changes to documentation
* **style:** formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
* **refactor:** refactoring production code
* **test:** adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
* **chore:** updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change

### The Subject
Subjects should be no greater than 50 characters, should begin with a capital letter and do not end with a period.

Use an imperative tone to describe what a commit does, rather than what it did. For example, use change; not changed or changes.

### The Body
Not all commits are complex enough to warrant a body, therefore it is optional and only used when a commit requires a bit of explanation and context. Use the body to explain the what and why of a commit, not the how.

When writing a body, the blank line between the title and the body is required and you should limit the length of each line to no more than 72 characters.

### The Footer
The footer is optional and is used to reference issue tracker IDs.
